Hello,
This is an attendance monitoring system made using open cv and python.
Attendance monitoring systems are a much more trusted and reliable means of recording attendance in classrooms and colleges
The chances of fake attendances and proxies becomes very less since each student is marked present only if they are present and detected by the system.
The same concept can be implemented in the corporate world and also in forensics fro criminal detection.
